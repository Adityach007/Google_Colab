# Google_Colab

Here I used OpenCV (Open source Computer Vision Library) and Google Colab.

First, I created the grayscale of the original image whoch is used for detection of objects.

Second, I learned about the Edge Detection which included
                              
          -> Erosion of the image
          -> Dilation of the image
                              
Third, I used a github repository and created a directory of it.

!git clone https://github.com/misbah4064/opencvTutorial.git

Then, completed
          
          -> Image manipulation.
          -> Drawing shapes and writing texts.
          -> Color Detection.
          -> Shape Detection.
          -> Face Detection (Different from face recognition).
After learning the above basics I created two projects:
          
          -> Tracking a ball.
          -> Face Recognition.

For Face Recognition I used the following are the datasets:

!git clone https://github.com/misbah4064/face_recognition.git

And the below command to install face recognition library on colab.

!pip install face_recognition

%cd face_recognition


Some of the results of my project are:

1. Drawing and writing on the images:

2. Face detection:

Note: This code of mine is not properly trained to detect the face so somewhere it detected other things as faces.

3. Shape detection:

4. Face Recognition:

For this, I used my own funny photo to derive the results.
